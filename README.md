## About the Project

This system integrates smartwatches, mobile apps, AI algorithms, and secure evidence management tools to:
1. Provide accurate doping predictions using real-time physiological data.
2. Assist investigative reporting with AI-suggested insights and evidence.
3. Manage Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) intelligently.
4. Integrate whistleblower data for enhanced doping detection.
5. Recommend pre-doping test actions, such as financial reviews and location checks.

## Key Features

### 1. Smartwatch & App Integration
- Collects real-time data (blood pressure, SpO2 levels, sleep patterns, etc.).
- Predicts doping risks and provides personalized insights.

### 2. Investigation Tools
- AI-powered investigative reporting.
- Whistleblower data integration with Athlete Biological Passport (ABP).
- Blockchain-based secure evidence management.
- Voice-to-text smart case documentation.

### 3. Real-Time Analytics
- Tracks athlete performance and compliance.
- Alerts for unexpected withdrawals or associations with sanctioned personnel.

### 4. Security & Encryption
- Zero Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs) for report verification.
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for secure data encryption.
- TLS 1.3 with IP anonymization ensures connection security.

## Technical Approach

### Data Collection & Integration
- **Smartwatch:** Collects physiological data in real-time.
- **Mobile App:** Displays analytics and integrates with backend storage.
- **Web Tools:** Scrapes data from social media and other public sources.

### Data Storage & Encryption
- **Session-based JWT Authentication.**
- **Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing:** Ensures secure protocol implementation.
- **zk-SNARK Proofs:** Verifies reports and evidence integrity.

### Evidence Management
- Blockchain-powered chain of custody.
- AI-driven categorization of evidence.

### Reporting
- Auto-suggests evidence inclusion.
- AI-recommended additional evidence sources.
