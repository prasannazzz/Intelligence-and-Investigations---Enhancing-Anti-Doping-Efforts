About the Project
This system integrates smartwatches, mobile apps, AI algorithms, and secure evidence management tools to:

Provide accurate doping predictions using real-time physiological data.
Assist investigative reporting with AI-suggested insights and evidence.
Manage Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) intelligently.
Integrate whistleblower data for enhanced doping detection.
Recommend pre-doping test actions, such as financial reviews and location checks.
Key Features
1. Smartwatch & App Integration
Collects real-time data (blood pressure, SpO2 levels, sleep patterns, etc.).
Predicts doping risks and provides personalized insights.
2. Investigation Tools
AI-powered investigative reporting.
Whistleblower data integration with Athlete Biological Passport (ABP).
Blockchain-based secure evidence management.
Voice-to-text smart case documentation.
3. Real-Time Analytics
Tracks athlete performance and compliance.
Alerts for unexpected withdrawals or associations with sanctioned personnel.
4. Security & Encryption
Zero Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs) for report verification.
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for secure data encryption.
TLS 1.3 with IP anonymization ensures connection security.
Technical Approach
Data Collection & Integration
Smartwatch: Collects physiological data in real-time.
Mobile App: Displays analytics and integrates with backend storage.
Web Tools: Scrapes data from social media and other public sources.
Data Storage & Encryption
Session-based JWT Authentication.
Shamir’s Secret Sharing: Ensures secure protocol implementation.
zk-SNARK Proofs: Verifies reports and evidence integrity.
Evidence Management
Blockchain-powered chain of custody.
AI-driven categorization of evidence.
Reporting
Auto-suggests evidence inclusion.
AI-recommended additional evidence sources.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
